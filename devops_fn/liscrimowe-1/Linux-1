Ok so this is exciting, we need linux don't have it? Get it! grab a machine and google how to install linux.
I'll allow to use whatever methods the only constraint is that it must be Centos7 if you struggle more than a full day then
go with ubuntu, but some of the commands or paths I'll outline in the rest of the course are going to be on Centos7.

Tasks:

1 - Install Centos7
    https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/InstallFromUSBkey - I would recommend to install it this way and find
    instructions for in case to have windows and don't want to loose it then partition the machine but that will 
    not be covered on the course. (If you have more trouble installing centos7 but already have ubuntu and don't
    want to install it or you can't then we can jump forward to docker getting a centos7 container using docker, but do try xD)
    
2 - Learn to move in linux
    So for this we will navigate through some directories most of this is homework and can be done at random times,
    I'll place a number of commands to read about and learn what you can of why do you use it and how could it be implemented
    also as simple as you can describe it in your own words, and place as snippet in the reference file for this assignment.
    
    mkdir- mkdir is used to create directories example:
	$ mkdir /home/os/NEWDIR
    cd-
    pwd-
    ps-
    ls-
    cp-
    mv-
    rm-
    cat-
    vi-
    which-
    who-
    history-
    
3 - More commands!
    Now we'll do the same with some basic routine commands and how to use, these could be from easy to complicated,
    but the "golden rule" for linux commands is to read the docs and more importantly to "man command" that will help
    you understand what its is, and what can you use it for.
    
    grep-
    df-
    du-
    ifconfig-
    ip.addr-
    free-
    top-
    sed-
    awk-

This is a work in progess about Devops, *nix, Neworking, yareyareyara
DORTS(DevOps Road To Success ) is a quick jumpstart to learn and improve and to help others with their careers, an effort to keep learning and put my skills to help others that are just starting.

Each course structure has a number next to its name that indicates the order in which it should be read, 
and each project has its own README please read it carefully before you start!

Also remember this journey will try the best to be updated, so keep track on github and check the update notes.

I'll assume you already have some linux experience because this was instructed to be cloned with git which will be a later introduction but I'll still walk through some basics for sysops positions that some often miss.
